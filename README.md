# Passenger-Counter-App
I studied with freeCodeCamp.org for this project.
Hi everyone!

This project is the first project of "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS4aFq5-91M&list=WL&index=31&t=4105s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org" video.
  
The comments in the js file in the project include the assignments and explanations in the video.
  
A project has been created in order to count the people entering a metro station in the video. 
On the other hand, I interpreted it in my own way to fit the covid situation we are in. 
In addition to the project, I added an extra decrement button and an element to show how many people are in the store.

Thanks for visiting my projects.
